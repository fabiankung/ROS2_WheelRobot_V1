# ROS2_WheelRobot_V1
Experimental codes for standard differential drive wheel robot
Hardware Target: Raspberry Pi 4B (4GB RAM)
Distribution: ROS2 Humble LTS
Lidar Sensor: LD06

This is an attempt to learn up the eco-system of ROS2, and also the Navigation2 library. I am building a basic wheel robot to test out my codes.
For video of the robot, please see: https://youtu.be/fhEOr7UUopw
